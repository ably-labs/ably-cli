// This is a template repository to be used for all Ably Labs demos, tools &amp; proof of concepts. Follow these steps to so this repo is easy to use for visitors & maintainers.

1. Update the description of this repo.
2. Add [topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) to this repo to clarify the language, tech stack and use case.
3. Update the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file with one of the [standard templates from GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
4. Update [dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml) with the [configuration for your project](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates).
5. Replace `https://github.com/ably-labs/ably-labs-template-repo/issues` with the actual link of the repo in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
6. Update this README so it provides enough information for people to understand how it works, how to run it locally and how it can be deployed to the cloud (see [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)).
7. Update the query string in the static asset link:
  - For the logo at the bottom of this README and
  - Please use a custom `favicon` if you're creating a web app. The favicon should use the ably static asset endpoint `<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="https://static.ably.dev/motif-red.svg?lorem-ipsum" />` and ensure this uses the same unique identifier as the Ably logo on the README.
  - More info in [this repo](https://github.com/ably-labs/static-assets).
8. Add a GitHub workflow to build/test/deploy your application. Use the [Ably Control API GitHub action](https://github.com/ably-labs/ably-control-api-action) to avoid creating Ably apps/API keys manually (see the `create-infra.yml` workflow in this repo).
9. Add this repository to the [selected repositories in the Ably Labs org](https://github.com/organizations/ably-labs/settings/actions) that are allowed to run GitHub Actions.

Once you're done, remove this section from the README. Good luck! üí™
